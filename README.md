# Hostel-Complain-System
With this project I provided an interface for 2 types of users that is for the students that are present 
in the hostel to report and post complaints Whereas people who have logged in as workers would receive 
these complaints based on what type of worker they are (eg - Electrical, Interior etc) Hence an electrical
worker will only receive an electrical issues to resolve
